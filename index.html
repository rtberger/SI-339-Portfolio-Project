                I am a student at the University of Michigan's School of Information on the Information Analysis pathway.
                I am also planning on applying to become a graduate student through the School of Information! </p>

        <div class="location">
            <p>I am from Demarest, New Jersey, which is a very small suburban town located
            right outside New York City. It is so small that the landmarks of the town are the local
            deli and the Dunkin' Donuts!</p>
