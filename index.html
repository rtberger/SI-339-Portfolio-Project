            <p> I am a student at the University of Michigan's School of Information on the Information Analysis pathway.
                I am also planning on applying to become a graduate student through the School of Information! </p>

            <p>I am from Demarest, New Jersey, which is a very small suburban town located
            right outside New York City. It is so small that the landmarks of the town are the local
            deli and the Dunkin' Donuts!</p>

            <p>My hometown and middle school were also in an SNL skit, 
                aptly titled "Your Hometown." Click the image to see the
                skit!</p>

            <p>My hobbies include hanging out with friends,
                watching TV, playing tennis, working out, 
                and playing video games.<br> <br>
            
            One of my favorite shows of all time is 
            "It's Always Sunny in Philidelphia," which 
            has its 15th season premiering on December 1st!
