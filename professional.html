            <p>As an intern at HEC Paris this past summer, I worked with an international team of people, 
                with colleagues from Ireland, Spain, and France, as a student liaison.  I also did projects for the recruitment team, which required me to use Python to parse files consisting
                of thousands of studentsâ€™ data and create marketing statistics based on demographic information and key variables from these documents. 
                They will be using my data visualizations as a part of their marketing tactics throughout this year to attract new students.</p>

            <p>I also worked part-time over the summer at East Coast Health Logistics, a COVID-19 testing company, 
                where I gathered COVID-19 testing data from lab results and compiled them on excel spreadsheets 
                in order to clearly illustrate patient information to clients. If there was ever a positive test, 
                we were able to notify clients expediently through these spreadsheets and take further actions from there to manage the situation. </p>

            <p>At Alliance Consulting Group, 
                I have directed a team of business analysts as a project manager for the last three semesters.
            Our projects so far have utilized market research and sales data to provide new pricing and promotional
            strategies to our clients.</p>
